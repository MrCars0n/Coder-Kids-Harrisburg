Coder Kids Harrisburg Teaching Resources - ages 5-17 curriculum, Python, LearnToMod and Scratch Projects

Coder Kids was founded in early 2014. It is a non-profit 501(c)3 registered organization, created to help both girls and boys ages 5 and up who are interested in computers and programming.

We teach kids how to make their own computer game, which is great fun for them. This teaches computational thinking, as well as specific concepts of computer science and programming. We are hoping this will spark interest in computer science and STEM careers in their future.

At the beginner level, we assume zero computer programming knowledge. We use the Scratch language from MIT, which is very easy to use and learn. At our more advanced level, for high school and middle school kids with programming experience, we are creating games using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more.

We especially want to encourage girls and kids from other underrepresented groups to get involved with learning programming and exploring STEM careers.

Workshops are free of charge. We hold our beginner workshops roughly once every other month, and our advanced workshops in the alternating month. The workshop also gives the kids an opportunity to present their game program to the group. Coder Kids is a great way to meet other kids with interest in technology.

We are a volunteer organization, with support from several corporations in Central PA; we need programming mentors, so if you have programming experience, please volunteer!

Note that all kids must be accompanied to the workshop by an adult over 18, or they won't be permitted to attend. You should bring a laptop to the workshop; if you don't have one, we do have several loaner units donated by generous companies and individuals.
